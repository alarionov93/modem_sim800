LPC1125 UART ring buffer example
================================

Example description
-------------------
This example shows how to use the UART in interrupt mode with transmit
and receive ring buffers.

To use the example, connect a serial cable to the board's RS232/UART port and
start a terminal program to monitor the port. The terminal program on the host
PC should be setup for 115200-8-N-1. Once the example is started, a brief message
is printed on terminal. Any data received will be echoed back to the terminal.

Board [NXP_LPCXPRESSO_1125]:
There are no special connection requirements for this example. The USB link (J6)
used for debug is also used to create a virtual serial port.
The terminal program on the host should be set to 115200-8-N-1.
